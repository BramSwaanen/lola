This repository contains the necessary code for the research *Beyond Translation: An Evaluatory Study of LogicLLaMA's Performance for Natural Language Inference*.

Dictionaries for evaluation can be obtained by running the notebook Dictionary-Creator (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17aHKSSeDpQvHjzoGQdrKQVbO1sCNwjkX?usp=sharing) either directly or one can copy it to their own Google Drive to edit and customize for alternative datasets.

The dictionaries containing the direct translation from LogicLLaMA for this research can be found in the folder <code>dictionaries</code>.
